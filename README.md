# EDA--Terrorism

As a part of my project for the internship program at The Sparks Foundation I completed the task to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism (Global Terrorism Dataset).
As a part of the project I found out the hot zones of terrorist attacks and also provided security issues and insights through EDA.
